Corrected the geometric algorithm:
         1.We used to generate a sphere at targeted coordinates for each spheres, which drew weird shape spheres, maybe because of the formula for normalization
         The right way : we should first generate a sphere at the origin and then push that sphere to the targeted coordinates.
         2. Decrease all coordinates by a factor of 10. Since our OPENGL universe is in a box of volume 1, we can't render things outside the box. Maybe it is another reason for the previous weird shapes
         
TODO_LIST:
        0.Define the normalization factor:
          Because our OPENGL coordinates only allow coordinate be in range (-1,1) for all x,y,z coordinates, some atoms with large value for coordinates such as
          62 H   H28        -0.19378    9.96085    7.70894, 
          are really hard to draw.
          So for each atom(sphere), we want to define a upperbound value UB such that all coordiantes are smaller than UB.
          Right now UB is set to a constant 10, but we want to make it a variable that is initiazed when a sphere is created.
          This initialization should be along with that for color, x, y, z and radius. 
        1.Assign colors to each atom
        2.Assign radius to each atom
        3.fix the tilt of molecule(Don't worry now, long-term goal)
