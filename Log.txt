Some important parameters in sphere class(same for every sphere object)
         Refinement: The depth of recursion of subdivisions, a nonnegative number. The intuition behind the subdivisions is that the more subdivision a programs does,
         the sphere looks more smooth. Therefore, increasing refinement should enhance the quality of sphere rendering. The tradeoff is the cost
         of computation. Currently, refinement is set to 2 because it looks good enough on my phone. We could variate it in future.
         
         NUM_OF_FACES: the number of triangles on the sphere. Same as refinement, more NUM_OF_FACES, more smooth the sphere is.
         
         These two parameters are specified at the very beginning of Sphere class. Be sure to change them correctly and together, otherwise it wouldn't
         compile. 
         Actually there is an easy formula that I invented for calculating NUM_OF_FACES:
                  NUM_OF_FACES = 20 * (4 ^ refinement)
         I was just so lazy to implement this formula. +.+ It is still something that needs doing...
         

Corrected the geometric algorithm:
         1.We used to generate a sphere at targeted coordinates for each spheres, which drew weird shape spheres, maybe because of the formula for normalization
         The right way : we should first generate a sphere at the origin and then push that sphere to the targeted coordinates.
         2. Decrease all coordinates by a factor of 10. Since our OPENGL universe is in a box of volume 1, we can't render things outside the box. Maybe it is another reason for the previous weird shapes
         
TODO_LIST:
        0.Define the normalization factor:
          Because our OPENGL coordinates only allow coordinate be in range (-1,1) for all x,y,z coordinates, some atoms with large value for coordinates such as
          62 H   H28        -0.19378    9.96085    7.70894, 
          are really hard to draw.
          So for each atom(sphere), we want to define a upperbound value UB such that all coordiantes are smaller than UB.
          Right now UB is set to a constant 10, but we want to make it a variable that is initiazed when a sphere is created.
          This initialization should be along with that for color, x, y, z and radius. 
        1.Assign colors to each atom
        2.Assign radius to each atom
        3.fix the tilt of molecule(Don't worry now, long-term goal)
