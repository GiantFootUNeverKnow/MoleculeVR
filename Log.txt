Some important parameters in sphere class(same for every sphere object)
         Refinement: The depth of recursion of subdivisions, a nonnegative number. The intuition behind the subdivisions is that the more subdivision a programs does,
         the sphere looks more smooth. Therefore, increasing refinement should enhance the quality of sphere rendering. The tradeoff is the cost
         of computation. Currently, refinement is set to 2 because it looks good enough on my phone. We could variate it in future.
         
         NUM_OF_FACES: the number of triangles on the sphere. Same as refinement, more NUM_OF_FACES, more smooth the sphere is.
         
         These two parameters are specified at the very beginning of Sphere class. Be sure to change them correctly and together, otherwise it wouldn't
         compile. 
         Actually there is an easy formula that I invented for calculating NUM_OF_FACES:
                  NUM_OF_FACES = 20 * (4 ^ refinement)
         I was just so lazy to implement this formula. +.+ It is still something that needs doing...
         

Corrected the geometric algorithm:
         1.We used to generate a sphere at targeted coordinates for each spheres, which drew weird shape spheres, maybe because of the formula for normalization
         The right way : we should first generate a sphere at the origin and then push that sphere to the targeted coordinates.
         2. Decrease all coordinates by a factor of 10. Since our OPENGL universe is in a box of volume 1, we can't render things outside the box. Maybe it is another reason for the previous weird shapes

The formula for detecting a switching:

The formula now is
 if(v[0]> 0.95 && v[1] <0.5 && v[2] < 0.5)
     then switch.

Where v is the upVector of the world created in app.
There are three components in v, each component of v is a float between [0,1]
I think the norm for v should be 1. Hence, if one component, say v[0], is dominant, the other two, v[1] and v[2], could be pretty small.

 If the phone is held portrait, v[0] is the dominant component
 If the phone is held landscape, which is usually the case for Cardboard App, v[1] is the dominant component
 If the phone is put flat on table, v[2] is the dominant component

We used this feature to detect whether the user wants to switch molecules. Since they usually hold the phone in landscape mode/ flat mode when they use
CardBoard headset, one component, v[0], should be small for the most of the time. When this component is dominant, we can regard it as an action that user
does it on purpose--tilting their heads..

And we have a timer in onNewFrame() thread which refreshed v value once per hundred times.

Parameters that maybe reconfigured later:
Criteria for a switching: now is x>0.95, y <0.5, z <0.5
Looping time: 100 times
Normalizing factor for molecule: now *(1/15)
Distance from origin: now 0.0
Background Color: now Black
Initial Molecule: now 0

Add the color-assigning feature to the app:
1.A file, colorpicker.txt, in /raw has the colors for each element. You can write comment in this file.
    The format for writing this file is
    [Element Symbol] [Red Component] [Green Component] [Blue Component]
    e.g.H 239 187 242 is giving H a pinkish color with RGB values in scale of 256
2.A method of TextParser.java, loadColor(BufferedReader bf), has been added
    This method takes an input of a file through a bufferedReader that is formatted as colorpicker.txt and
    uses its coloring to update ColorHashTable, a hashmap that stores color for each element
3. In surfaceCreated method, parser.loadColor() is called before parser.parse() to predefine coloring of elements
4. Found a bug in parser.parse().
    The parser can only parse lines before 98.


05/18/2015
1.Fix the bug in parser.parse()
    The parser now should be able to read through a table in raw data
2.Add a file, cpk_coloring to raw folder. This is a coloring conventionally used by chemists, so we adapt to this coloring.
3.Pre-normalize coordinates in given molecule data.
 After normalization, all coordinates(x,y,z) should be in range [-0.8,0.8].
 An atom set at 0.8 is the maximum(rightmost, uppermost, or farthest) atom in that dimension
 Inversely, an atom set at -0.8 is the minimum(leftmost, lowermost, or nearest) atom in that dimension.
 The rest of atoms are linearly interpolated between -0.8 and 0.8.
 Specific Normalization Formula:
        z_i = 1.6 * ( (x_i - min)/(max - min) - 0.5 )
 The reason why 0.8 is used instead of 1.0 is to provide a better vision of the whole molecule(no clipping on edges of models)
4.Modified the algorithm to modeling.
    (i).Instead of creating spheres along with parsing a text file, now the program first finished all parsing job and then creating spheres based on normalized
    coordinates. The normalization has to happen after all parsing because it requires to know all coordinates in a molecule.
        This change happens in TextParser.parse()
     (ii).Since the coordinates given in text-file is not necessarily between [-1.0,1.0], they need to be resized before modelling.
     Without normalization,the program used to adopt a dumb approach to resize: it defined a temporary "refactoring constant" UB, then divided all coordinates by
     UB. The value of VB is determined merely by experiments and is not guaranteed to be a precise value at all. Now that there is normalization, UB is not needed.
        However, there is still trace of UB remained in Sphere.setCoordinate() because of another resizing! We generated Spheres with different centers but the program
     didn't assign radius to them yet. Hence, UB, as a spare variable, is a convenient constant to represent a "uniform radius" that is applied to all atoms.
     I know it is a lazy & dangerous practice to reuse an existing variable for a different purpose, but for the sake of now, just leave it there.
     I'll implement radius feature immediately as the first task and get rid of UB completely.


Parameters that maybe reconfigured later:
Criteria for a switching: now is x>0.95, y <0.5, z <0.5
Looping time: 100 times
Size of frame of molecules: [-0.8,0.8]*[-0.8,0.8]*[-0.8,0.8]
Distance from origin: now 0.0
Background Color: now Black
Initial Molecule: now 2

05/19/2015
0.Added a file atommass.txt which has atomic mass for all elements
1.Added a method TextParser.loadAtomMass() that could load atomic mass for each element from atommass.txt
2.Adjust radius of a sphere according to the atomic mass of that element by the following algorithm:
    After TextParser finishes parsing, it stores atomic masses of all atoms in the molecule to an array and normalizes their masses
        The formula used for normalization:
        z_i = ( (x_i - min)/(max - min) + 1 ), where max&&min are the maximum && minimum of the array
    Hence, the resulting masses are between 1.0f and 2.0f.
        An atom with normalized mass 2.0f is the heaviest atom of the molecule
        An atom with normalized mass 1.0f is the lightest atom of the molecule
        (This 2:1 ratio is adjustable)
    Then TextParser passes masses to Sphere constructor as one argument.
    Sphere class generates a sphere by using this formula to normalize its vertices
        vertices[i] = (vertices[i]  * radius )/RESIZING_FACTOR + xCoord
        ~~ + yCoord
        ~~ + zCoord
        RESIZING_FACTOR is also an adjustable constant
3. Filter out invalid arguments passed into Sphere's constructor. If there is any illegal argument, IllegalArgumentException would occur
4. Sophisticate TextParser.normalize()
    Temporarily option a is used for normalizing coordinates, normalizing a random array to range [-0.8f,0.8f]
                option b is used for normalizing atomic masses, normalizing a random array to range [1.0f,2.0f]
    Details are on the comments of codes
5. Generalize the codes for read in more molecules file. Now, the only change that is needed to incorporate more molecules is to change the constant
    NUM_OF_MOLECULES.
        Be sure to add molecules in the natural order. e.g. molecule4 following molecule3

Parameters that maybe reconfigured later:
Criteria for a switching: now is x>0.95, y <0.5, z <0.5
Looping time: 100 times
Size of frame of molecules: [-0.8,0.8]*[-0.8,0.8]*[-0.8,0.8]
Range of radii of atoms; [1.0,2.0]
RESIZING_FACTOR: 20
Distance from origin: now 0.0
Background Color: now Black
Initial Molecule: now 2

05/21/2015
1.Add oscillation feature to molecule
    -A new function called adjustVertices(int index) will be called each time a frame is drawn,
    which takes care of various adjustment to molecule that could be added in future
    -By now, this function moves each atom by a random translational vector that is within scale 0.01
    i.e. all components of the vector should be at most 0.01, at least -0.01. For each frame, different random vectors
    would be generated and used to different atoms. Basically, these atoms shake irregularly.
2. It seems to be bit hard for a large cell to move, the calculation is quite large. Maybe consider to use another Timer to control the oscillation or
oscillate once for every few frames

05/22/2015
1.Temporarily shut down/ commented out the feature of oscillation because this feature needs heavy workload on each frame
2.Added an attribute elem_name to Sphere class that would be passed in when initialization
    -There is no argument checking for this argument, leave it blank when it is still unnecessary
3.Managed to draw bondings on screen
    The whole process is described as follows:
    (i.)On the last step of method TextParser.parse() after all information of atoms are known and properly processed, the program calls a new method
        TextParser.createBonds()
    (ii.)All calculations about the decision if two atoms should be connected through a bond are done within createBonds()
        An atom is only connected to a group of atoms that are in the shortest distance from it.
        The program constructed a hashTable that records such group of atoms for each atom.
        This group of atoms is found by a linearly search for minimum distance through all atoms in that molecule.
        (*)Concern1: Right now, as a result of this algorithm, sizes of the group "Nearest Neighbors" described above is always 1. A bit suspicious!
            I guess for some atom in the sample, such as Nitrogen, their number of nearest neighbors should be three hydrogen atoms.
        (*)Concern2: This algorithm could be accelerated by construction of a K-d Tree. (Takes approximately 3 hours to do such a boost)
        (*)Concern3: Finding such "Nearest Neighbors" may not be very meaningful. For example, the nearest neighbor of some Bromine in the sample would be
            a hydrogen, but in reality, they are not supposed to be connected. The Bromine belongs to the cage that is consisted of Pb and Br.
    (iii.)Interface for communications between MainActivity and TextParser is established by three functions
        TextParser.outputBonds(),TextParser.outputBondingColors(), TextParser.outputNumOfBonds()
        outputBonds() reformats the hashTable "Nearest Neighbors" built in step(ii) to a simple array readable by functions in MainActivity
        outputBindingColors() loads in coloring for a bond connecting two atoms by interpolation of colors of those two atoms
        outputNumOfBonds() simply returns a private variable of TextParser that records number of bonding for the molecule.
            This value would be reset each time createBonds() is called
    (iv.)In MainActivity.onSurfaceCreated(), the program constructs an OPENGL program for rendering bonding in the same way it renders atoms of the molecule
        This program would be fed in data from the output of the interfaces described in (iii.)
    (v.) All the framework codes for rendering atoms and rendering bondings are similar except that we use GL.LINES for bondings instead of GL.TRIANGLES
        drawBondings() method would be called after drawMolecule()
            (*)Concern4: Wouldn't doing just GL.LINES be so simple representation of a bond? Considering adjust thickness of these OPENGL lines
            (*)Concern5: Will oscillation feature implemented before be smoothly applied to a molecule with bondings? I am afraid that the shaking makes lines
                discontinue
    (vi.) All variables used to build a molecule have their counterparts for building bondings

1.Resolved concern1 mentioned in the last post.
    -Modified TextParser.CreateBonds()
    -Replace the absolute comparing standard by a standard with a tolerance so that a group of nearest neighbors could be obtained when these neighbors are
    only different in distances with the floating point representation, i.e., if these neighbors are physically in equal distances, they would all be
    considered the nearest neighbors
    -The strategy applied to picking nearest neighbors is the following:
    distance graph: ______0__________[3]_____(minDist-tolerance)_____[1]__________minDist_______[2]__________(minDist+tolerance)_____[4]_______
    For example, the optimal neighbor for a certain atom X is minDist away from it. newDist is the distance between X and any one of atoms in the molecule
    There is a predefined constant named "bonding_tolerance".
    Situation[3]:If an atom is less than minDist-tolerance from X, the atom would be considered a new nearest neighbor and the only one nearest neighbor
    Situation[1]:If an atom is less than minDist from X, while this amount of optimization is very possibly due to floating-point representation, both this atom and
    all previous found nearest neighbors are the nearest neighbors, with minDist = (minDist + newDist)/2
    Situation[2]:If an atom is more than minDist from X, while this amount of exceeding is very possibly due to floating-point representation, both this atom and
    all previous found nearest neighbors are the nearest neighbors, with minDist unchanged
    Situation[4]:If an atom is far more than minDist from X such that floating-point representation is no longer a valid excuse, this atom is not a candidate for
    the nearest neighbors.
2.Resolved concern4 mentioned in the last post.
    -Since openGL ES2.0 has not provided any function to adjust thickness of a line, a method that Google's results suggested is to draw a cylinder to represent a
    line with thickness.
    -A book written by Jim X. Chen "3D Programming ***" has the code I want, which uses subdivision to render a cylinder
    -The algorithm is simply enough:
    (i.)Use Liu Hui's π algorithm to approximate a circle
    (ii.)Duplicate another circle that is exactly same as the circle drawn in (i)
    (iii.)Connect corresponding points on these two circles
    !!!
    -Created a class Cylinder.java to implement this algorithm
        -General structure , methods and member variables are similar to that of Sphere
        -A cylinder has coordinates of and colors of the two centers of circles as arguments of construction.
        -It models a cylinder based on these two circles but these two base face wouldn't be modelled. i.e. Only a tube-like object is to be drawn
        -This cylinder would be placed between the two endpoints and assigned their colors
        -Color would be interpolated on the cylinder
        -Cylinder has the same parameters as Sphere has, which are also publicly accessible:
            DEGREE_OF_REFINEMENT
            NUMBER_OF_FACES
            NUMBER_OF_VERTICES
            NUMBER_OF_COORDS
            NUMBER_OF_COLORS
            If DEGREE_OF_REFINEMENT is changed, NUMBER_OF_FACES has to change correspondingly. Formula # of faces = 8 * (2^degree_of_refinement)
        -RESIZING_FACTOR is a predefined constant that decides the radius of a cylinder. I manually set it to 75.0, which may not be an optimal value
        -A tube is composed of many triangles
    -Adjust TextParser and MainActivity.
        -Added a method TextParser.formBonds() that takes care of creating an array of Cylinder objects(containers)
        -Simplify interface methods outputBonds() and outputBondingColors(). Now they are more readable
        -Use GL.TRIANGLES to draw bonds instead of naive GL.LINES
3. Concern5 above doesn't really matter for current setting

1.Renamed the shaders
2.Added interpolation method to util.java
    -util.interpolate() could be used on interpolate a vector to a vector or a scalar to a vector
    -two version provided, so the returned type is either a scalar or an array with the same size as the original value
3.Adopted Paul Bourke's marching cube codes to generate an isosurface
    -Created a class named Isosurface
    -There are two constructors:
        -Simple one: Load a 3-dimensional array of discrete scalar fields and a value denoting the level of isosurface to draw
        -Sophisticated one: Load a 3-dimensional array of discrete scalar fields , a value denoting the level of isosurface to draw, and
            the ranges for x,y and z dimension
    -Each Isosurface object should have an array of vertex coordinates and an array of colors(not done yet)
    -Indexing for unit cube is described by this graph. This indexing could be random, as long as being consistent
        /**             4 -------- 5
         *             /|        / |

1. Created a testing class s_functions. There is only one class function in this class: this function generates a 3-D array where each element has an associated value
This value is actually x^2 + y^2 + z^2
2. Tested Isosurface class and assigns a fixed color for Isosurface class, i.e., every object of Isosurface would have the same color
3. Constructed infrastructure for Isosurface in MainActivity.
    -Used s_function to prepare data for an example isosurface (named I6) that has no physical meaning with drawn molecules.
    -Created an openGL program for isosurface and associative global variables(Caution: instead of declaring an array of such program, I just declare one for example)
    -Added function MainActivity.drawIsosurface() that sends data to openGL program of Isosurface
    -Called MainActivity.drawIsosurface() in MainActivity.onDrawEye()
4. Added a public variable nTriangle for Isosurface class just for convenience

2.Adjusted looping time for receiving a switch signal, reducing it from 100 loops to 40 loops
3.Assigned colors to isosurface with a dynamic "semi-random" scheme. We can still associate colors for isosurface to something that may be useful in future.
    Right now the temporary scheme is quite sweet when displayed.

1.Added interface for accessing normals for Sphere class, the same thing will be added for Isosurface and Cylinder later.
    -Actually, normals are the same across all sphere so I am considering making normals a static variable for Sphere class, but due to
     the generality across all geometries which may be added soon, this improvement should be postponed.
2.Added another function for s_function class, namely n().
    -This function generates a parabola in 3-d space, its variable used in MainActivity is named I7.
    -It is just for testing

2015/06/04
0.Previous concerns[2 && 3] resolved
    -We will bond pairs of atoms in a specific range given by an informative file instead of simple nearest neighbors strategy
1.Generated .apk for this app
    -Keystore stored in D:\实习类\moleculeVR_keystore
    -Password is "My assigned working room(4 Capital letter + 4 numbers)"
2.Removed the gigantic molecule
    -Performance increases strikingly
3.Disabled fake shading
4.Assembled new Google cardboard and tested the app on that with its magnet
5.Added lighting to molecules' program and to bondings'
    -The shader codes and the position of point lighting I used was modified from Google's demo app
    -Only diffusive component was added, whereas specular component was not.
    -Added outputNormals() and outputBondingNormals() to TextParser class
    -Added constant NUMBER_OF_NORMALS to Sphere and Cylinder class
    -Calculated shading/lighting in vertex.shader
    -Since Isosurface has no normal vectors nor lighting information(There is no way they could make sense), it probably should use another shader file.
     Right now, the mechanism by which it works is the program of Isosurface does not enable normal variables in its shader and then compile only very
     small part of codes. It is an amazing feature of GLSL, for which the same shader codes could be compiled into different programs. However, I still
     plan to separate these shader files later.
     -Calculations of normals of Cylinder is not right now, which needs a formula of 3-Dimensional rotation that I am still working on
     -The lighting could be improved/played in these few ways:
        (*)Adjust ambient component
        (*)Add specular component
        (*)Change lower bound set for diffusion
        (*)Adjust the position of the light source
        (*)Use parallel light/ multiple light instead of single light source
        (*)Change quality/intensity/color of lighting

1. Changed how bondings are chosen
    -Introduced a new hash table elem_atom_number that hashes a string of element symbol to its atomic number.
    This table is initialized along with atommass table in TextParser.loadAtomMass()
    -Added an argument for TextParser.parse() that is a buffer for bonding information of the molecule
    -Created files bonding*.txt that has information for bondings. Added necessary codes in MainActivity to load such files.
    -Created two matrices bonding_UB and bonding_LB for storing bonding information in class TextParser
        -They are reset and updated when a new molecule is loaded
        -For any pair of atoms within a molecule, there is a lowerbound and an upperbound;
        -A bond is only created when distance between two atoms is less than their lowerbound and not greater than their upperbound
        -Both bonding_UB and bonding_LB are read directly from bonding*.txt, and measured in the same scale as vertices' coordinates in molecule*.txt
        -The algorithm determines whether a bond is created by the scale used by bonding_UB and bonding_LB, and if it should be created, draw the
         bond using the normalized coordinates.
     -Deleted Nearest Neighbors hashtable and method createBonds().
     -Added method parseBondingInfo() to parse files of bonding information
     -Modified method formBonds() to fit the new algorithm
2. Adjusted access level for TextParser class
3. Temporarily shut down the isosurface
4. Added a passthrough shader to be the vertex shader of isosurface so that it separates shader for molecules from shader from isosurface
5. Adjusted brightness and transparency of the isosurface

TODOLIST:
1.Parse density files and match it to its molecule
2.Add sound track to the app
----------Long Term---------------------------------------
0.Calculate correct normals for bonding/ don't use shading on bondings
1.Add perspective transformation
2.Construct an array of isosurfaces(one for each molecule model)?
3.Define an abstract class Geometry as base class of Sphere,Cylinder and Isosurface
4.Extract the method to process a geometric model

1.Added a naive parsing function to parse the density file, TextParser.loadDensity().
    -Same as loadColor(), loadAtomMass(), it takes a bufferedReader as argument, but return type of loadDensity() is a 3-dimensional array of floats
    -There are always data missing during parsing, and then the parsing couldn't finish its job with java.util.NoSuchElementException being raised.
    -So I added a "safety catch" that sets coordinates to be 0.0f when there is no such coordinate
    -I think this is not safe at all but I don't have any idea why data are missing and no ideas how to handle the problem nicely
2.Added Isosurface I8 in the last part of MainActivity.onSurfaceCreated()
    -I8 is different than I6 and I7 in that I8 is a collection of density data read from a specific file instead of calculating density based on
    math formula
    -Some parts of codes about I8 are still commented
    -Right now the app could still display only one isosurface, not depending on what molecule is displayed
    -Switch on I6,I7 and I8 can't be done on the runtime. Instead, they could be easily switched if you edited the codes.
3.The format of a well-written density file:
    -Start with 3 integers a,b,c, representing how many scalars in x,y,z dimensions, respectively
    -Followed by a*b*c floating numbers, preferably with 3-4 significant digits
    -For loading the data efficiently, a, b ,c are supposed to be less than 35.
     e.g. A file in dimension 35*35*35 takes about 7 seconds' overhead to read in.
4.Changed some parsing codes
5. Loading Time Issue:
Calculating electronic density based on the formula takes 3-5 seconds for one instance for 50*50*50.
Loading data from file takes 7 seconds for one isosurface instance of size 35* 35 * 35
Loading data from file takes 1 seconds for one isosurface instance of size less than 20* 20 * 20
Loading data from file takes 2.5 seconds for one isosurface instance of size 25 * 25 * 25
Loading data from file takes 5 seconds for one isosurface instance of size 30 * 30 * 30

1.Temporarily turn off rendering of molecules and bondings.
2.Succeeded in drawing out isosurfaces in density2.txt and found the right isolevels to draw: 4888 and 8960
3.Changed from drawing just one isosurface instance to drawing NUM_OF_MOLECULE isosurfaces
    -Declare global variables in the same format as those for molecules
    -Wrote setup codes in a separate for loop after setup codes for molecules
    -Currently it's only drawing two isosurfaces from one file simultaneously
    -When data for the rest isosurfaces are available, draw one isosurface for each molecule
    -Again,  when data for other isosurfaces are ready, organize setup codes including I8, I9, s_value,
     n_value into for loop that should systematically set up all preparation for rendering isosurfaces
4.Wrote locally a python script that could reformat given density file into an ideal textfile
5.Added mediaplayer to play music that is switched along with molecule
    -For each molecule, there is one music
    -All music are named by "bgmx.txt", where x is its index

06/18/2015
1.Added projection matrix to the molecules, but it does not look good
    -The bonding disappeared totally
    -Some atoms looked gigantic but the others looked tiny
    -Molecules don't rotate as the phone spins
    -I decided to comment this projection
2.Fixed the indexing of molecule when switching

06/21/2015
1.Added class Drawable, a class that handles all details of openGL rendering such as creating openGL program, passing uniform variables for openGL progam.
    -Planned to transfer all codes for openGL rendering from MainActivity to Drawables. Codes to render atoms and bonding has been transferred and work well.
    -Some auxiliary functions such as effect of jiggling will be added to Drawables in a form of helper function called when optional parameters are passed in
    -The process to add a model is then simplified as a two steps operation in regard of codes in MainActivity class:
        (i)Create a new Drawable object with necessary arguments: array of positions, array of colors, vertex shader, fragment shader, name of object, number of sub-items...
        (ii)Call draw() for the object when necessary, with arguments: lightPosition, modelMatrix, modelViewMatrix, number of vertices
    -The interface of Drawable could be improved depending on future's needs
    -Error message within Drawable class would be displayed with TAG="Drawable" and message content containing name of the object that raises exceptions.
2. Cleaned codes in MainActivity
    -Replaced intimidating codes of openGL calls by function calls of Drawable class
    -Removed pages of declarations and initialization
    -Removed drawing functions for every kinds of objects
    -Refined codes as much as I could

06/22/2015
1.Moved adjustVertices() to Drawable class
    -When calling draw(), an object that needs jiggling has to set jiggle=true
2.Succeeded in rendering Isosurface by using Drawable class.
    -When calling draw(), an object that has no associated normals has to set lightPoInEyeSpace=null
3.Reorganized codes of MaincActivity
    -Deleted old drawMolecule(), drawBonding(), and drawIsosurface()
    -Replaced codes of openGL for creating openGL program for isosurface by function calls of Drawable class
    -Created new drawMolecule(), drawBonding(), and drawIsosurface(). They are merely a wrapper of function call Drawable.draw()
    with different parameters.
    -Beautified onDrawEye() function
    -Deleted unrevelant declarations of global variables

06/24/2015
1.Generated density2.txt that is the density isosurface file for molecule2. Also renamed the original density2.txt
    to density3.txt
  Generated density4.txt that is the density isosurface file for molecule4.
2.Wrote a title on the screen when initialization, replacing debugging message "Succeeded in creating this!"
3.Standardized rendering of isosurface
    -An object of isosurface would only be created if there is a associated file in folder, otherwise the reference would be assigned to null
    -Rendering of isosurface would only be created if its reference is non-null
    -Two isosurfaces are available for each molecule, whose isolevels are read from file densityx.txt through Textparser
    -Now only the primary isolevel would be shown on screen
4.Adjusted the reading order of coordiantes for density file to an optimal order for matching molecules, though mismatch sill exists
    -The outermost loop is y_coordinate
    -Medium loop is z_coordinate
    -The innermost loop is x_coordinate
5.Added the fifth molecule MgO, along with its density, which seems to be opposite from expected, but its shape makes sense

06/26/2015
1.Added titles of molecule, appearing when molecules are switched.
2.Fixed disappearing bgm of molecule 4
3.Generated APK version 1.4, in which there are 5 molecules and three density.

06/30/2015
1.Removed the first molecule, which was designed for testing
2.Modified the format of file that describes a molecule:
    TITLE
    [OPTIONAL ATTRIBUTE]
    CELL x_size y_size z_size
    [OPTIONAL ATTRIBUTE]
    ATOMS
    NAME X Y Z
    {element1 name} {x coordinate} {y coordinate} {z coordinate}
    {element2 name} {x coordinate} {y coordinate} {z coordinate}
    {element3 name} {x coordinate} {y coordinate} {z coordinate}
        ...
    {element[x] name} {x coordinate} {y coordinate} {z coordinate}
    EOF
